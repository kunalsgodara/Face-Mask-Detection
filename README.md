# A Real-Time Face Mask Detection system! 😷💻

Using Python, Keras, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, I've built a robust model leveraging MobileNetV2 for accurate mask detection. Here are some key highlights:

Achieved a training accuracy of 96% and a validation accuracy of 98%.

Implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's generalization.

Fine-tuned the model to balance performance and computational efficiency.

# 🔍 Features:

Real-time video stream processing.

Efficient and accurate detection using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

I’m thrilled with the outcomes and the potential applications of this technology in enhancing public health and safety. A big thank you to the open-source community and everyone who supported this project!
